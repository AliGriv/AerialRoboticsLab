# Useful Repositories
1. [NatNet Example Project](https://github.com/AliGriv/NatNet_Example): Helping to stream position data from Optitrack Motion Capture on Linux Machine 
2. [CSV Writer](https://github.com/AliGriv/CSVWriter): I used this for writing CSV files in C++.
3. [CUDA Start Project](https://github.com/AliGriv/cuda-start): This can be used to start CUDA programming. Assuming you have an Nvidia graphic card and Linux machine.
4. [Crazyflie with Python](https://github.com/AliGriv/Crazyflie_test): Assuming you want to fly Crazyflies using Optitrack system, here is a basic Python-based project to get you started.
5. [Mosek 9.3 Wrapper](https://github.com/AliGriv/mosek): This helps to integrate Mosek toolbox with your CMake projects. It is based on the latest version of the time.
6. [Joystick Library](https://github.com/AliGriv/JoystickLibrary): I used this to read Joystick input with C++ programming.
7. [Crazyflie with C++](https://github.com/AliGriv/Crazyflie_NatNet_cpp): This is basically the C++ version of the [Crazyflie with Python](https://github.com/AliGriv/Crazyflie_test). Use it if you want to fly Crazyflies with C++.
8. [Crazyswarm](https://github.com/AliGriv/crazyswarm): I haven't done much work here, but I was working with Crazyswarm/ROS package in the Lab and it needed a few tweaks to get it going.
